# Description 

The readable app is a project for the react-redux class from Udacity. The goal is to build an app similar to Reddit/Hacker News.

# Instructions

In order to run this project, you have to:

```
git clone git@github.com:guigacarvalho/readable-project.git
yarn && yarn start
```

Your default browser should open the app on http://localhost:3000/ and you'll probably get the Not Found app screen.

![Not Found](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3665969/31906704-a12a1ca4-b7e6-11e7-825c-24a5c6758706.png "Not Found app screen")

Because you're not running the app's backend, the app won't have any data to show. See the instructions below in order to run the backend.

You can also use `yarn build` to build the app for production.


# Instructions to run the app's backend

You can clone this repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter.git
cd reactnd-project-readable-starter/api-server/
yarn && yarn start
```

The node server will be up and running on http://localhost:3001/.
